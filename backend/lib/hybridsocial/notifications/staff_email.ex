defmodule Hybridsocial.Notifications.StaffEmail do
  @moduledoc """
  Generic fan-out for admin-targeted transactional emails. Finds
  every staff member that (a) holds any role, (b) has the required
  permission, and (c) has opted into the given notification key for
  email, then delivers a builder-produced Swoosh email to each one —
  once per throttle window per recipient.

  Throttle window is `moderation_email_throttle_seconds` (default
  600s); the same key that gates `moderation_queue` emails. We
  share it deliberately: a burst of reports shouldn't spam every
  admin either, and if an operator lowers the window they want it
  lowered uniformly.

  `notification_key`: matches the `notification_preferences.type` a
  staff member must have set to email=true (e.g. `"admin_new_report"`).

  `required_permission`: RBAC permission the staff member must hold
  to be relevant for this event (e.g. `"reports.manage"`). Users
  without this permission are skipped — no point emailing them
  about something they can't act on.

  `build_email`: 2-arity fn `(to_email, identity) -> Swoosh.Email`.
  The identity is passed so the builder can personalize (use handle,
  display_name) and log failures against a recipient.
